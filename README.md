# Blackjack Game!
A replication of the popular 1 vs 1 black jack game, with some modification on the game rules. This project is created by me to enhance my understanding on the Javascript Programming
Language. 

# Installation
The installation is very simple, and you will need only two steps:
* Clone the repository to your local machine
* Run the website via Visual Studio Code's Live Server, and you are good to go. For more information about Live Server, please visit [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) page.

#Techstack Involved
There is only standard techstack involved, which includes:
* HTML
* CSS
* Pure Javascript
All development process is done with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
